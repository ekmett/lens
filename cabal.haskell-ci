-- Because we use a custom Setup script, --test-show-details can only support
-- the options that come with the version of Cabal that is linked against.
-- Unfortunately, --test-show-details=direct wasn't introduced until
-- Cabal-1.24.*, and GHC 7.10 and earlier ship with an older version of Cabal
-- than that. As a result, trying to pass --test-show-details=direct won't work
-- on these GHC versions unless we rebuild Cabal from scratch, which is
-- time-consuming. As a result, we simply disable --test-show-details=direct
-- as a quick-but-dirty workaround.
