-- We make heavy use of type namespace markers in the Haddocks (e.g., t'Lens')
-- to work around https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/1608. These markers
-- were first introduced in Haddock 2.23, bundled with GHC 8.8. Because old
-- versions of Haddock do not gracefully handle these markers, we simply do not
-- build the Haddocks on CI unless we are using GHC 8.8 or later.
