synopsis:      Families of Lenses, Folds and Traversals
description:
  The combinators in @Control.Lens@ provide a highly generic toolbox for composing
  families of getters, folds, traversals, setters and lenses.
  .
  /Getter/
  .
  A @'Getter' a b c d@ is just any function @(a -> c)@, which we've flipped into continuation
  passing style, @forall r. (c -> r) -> a -> r@ and decorated with 'Const' to obtain
  .
  > type Getter a b c d = forall r. (c -> Const r d) -> a -> Const r b
  .
  Everything you can do with a function, you can do with a 'Getter', but note that because of the
  continuation passing style (.) composes them in the opposite order.
  .
  Since it is only a function, every 'Getter' obviously only retrieves a single value for a given
  input.
  .
  /Fold/
  .
  A @'Fold' a b c d@ is a generalization of something 'Foldable'. It allows you to
  extract multiple results from a container. A 'Foldable' container can be
  characterized by the behavior of @foldMap :: (Foldable t, Monoid m) => (c -> m) -> t c -> m@.
  Since we want to be able to work with monomorphic containers, we generalize this signature to
  @forall m. 'Monoid' m => (c -> m) -> a -> m@, and then decorate it with 'Const' to obtain
  .
  > type Fold a b c d = forall m. Monoid m => (c -> Const m d) -> a -> Const m b
  .
  Every 'Getter' is a valid 'Fold' that simply doesn't use the 'Monoid' it is passed.
  .
  Everything you can do with a 'Foldable' container, you can with with a 'Fold' and there are
  combinators that generalize the usual 'Foldable' operations in @Control.Lens@.
  .
  /Traversal/
  .
  A @'Traversal' a b c d@ is a generalization of 'traverse' from 'Traversable'. It allows
  you to traverse over a structure and change out its contents with monadic or
  applicative side-effects. Starting from
  @'traverse' :: ('Traversable' t, 'Applicative' f) => (c -> f d) -> t c -> f (t d)@,
  we monomorphize the contents and result to obtain
  .
  > type Traversal a b c d = forall f. Applicative f => (c -> f d) -> a -> f b
  .
  Every 'Traversal' can be used as a valid 'Fold', because given a 'Monoid' @m@, we have an 'Applicative' for @('Const' m)@.

  Everything you can do with a 'Traversable' container, you can with with a 'Traversal', and there
  are combinators that generalize the usual 'Traversable' operations in @Control.Lens@.
  .
  /Setter/
  .
  A @'Setter' a b c d@ is a generalization of 'fmap' from 'Functor'. It allows you to map into a
  structure and change out the contents, but it isn't strong enough to allow you to
  enumerate those contents. Starting with @fmap :: 'Functor' f => (c -> d) -> f c -> f d@
  we monomorphize the type to obtain @(c -> d) -> a -> b@ and then decorate it with 'Identity' to obtain
  .
  > type Setter a b c d = (c -> Identity d) -> a -> Identity b
  .
  Every 'Traversal' is a valid 'Setter', since 'Identity' is 'Applicative'.
  .
  Everything you can do with a 'Functor', you can do with a 'Setter', and there are combinators that
  generalize the usual 'Functor' operations in @Control.Lens@.
  .
  /Lens/
  .
  A @'Lens' a b c d@ is a purely functional reference.
  .
  While a 'Traversal' was a valid 'Fold', it wasn't a valid 'Getter'. To make the 'Applicative'
  for 'Const' it required a 'Monoid' for the argument we passed it, which a 'Getter' doesn't recieve.
  .
  However, the instance of 'Functor' for 'Const' requires no such thing. If we weaken the type
  requirement from 'Applicative' to 'Functor' for 'Traversal', we obtain 
  .
  > type Lens a b c d = forall f. Functor f => (c -> f d) -> a -> f b
  .
  Every 'Lens' is a valid 'Setter', choosing @f@ = 'Identity'.
  .
  Every 'Lens' is a valid 'Fold' that doesn't use the 'Monoid' it is passed.
  .
  Every 'Lens' is a valid 'Traversal' that only uses the 'Functor' part of the 'Applicative' it is supplied.
  .
  Every 'Lens' is a valid 'Getter', choosing @f@ = 'Const' @r@ for an appropriate @r@
  .
  Since every 'Lens' is a valid 'Getter' it follows that it must view exactly one element in the structure.
  .
  The lens laws follow from this property and the desire for it to act like a 'Functor' when used as a 'Setter'.
  .
  /Composition/
  .
  Note that all of these types are type aliases, and you can compose these lenses with mere function compositon.
  .
  This is a generalization of the well-known trick for @(.).(.)@ or @fmap.fmap@, and their less well-known cousins
  @foldMap.foldMap@ @traverse.traverse@. It follows because each one is a function between values of type @(x -> f y)@
  and the composition takes the intersection of supplied functionality for you automatically!
  .
  /Lens Families/
  .
  For a longer description of why you should care about lenses, and an overview of why we use 4
  parameters a, b, c, and d instead of just 2, see <http://comonad.com/reader/2012/mirrored-lenses/>.
  .
  Sometimes you won't need the flexibility those extra parameters afford you and you can use
  .
  > type Simple f a b = f a a b b
  .
  to describe a 'Simple' 'Lens', 'Simple' 'Traversal' or 'Simple' 'Setter'.
  .
  /Avoiding Dependencies/
  .
  Note: If you merely want your library to /provide/ lenses you may not
  have to actually import /any/ lens library at all. For, say, a
  @'Simple' 'Lens' Bar Foo@, just export a function with the signature:
  .
  > foo :: Functor f => (Foo -> f Foo) -> Bar -> f Bar
  .
  and then you can compose it with other lenses using nothing more than @(.)@ from the Prelude.
  .
  /Deriving Lenses/
  .
  You can derive lenses automatically for many data types using 'Control.Lens.TH', and if a
  container is fully characterized by its lenses, you can use 'Control.Lens.Representable' to
  automatically derive 'Functor', 'Applicative', 'Monad', and 'Derivable'.
